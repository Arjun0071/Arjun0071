## 👋 Hi there, I'm Arjun!

I'm a DevOps and cloud enthusiast with hands-on experience in automating infrastructure using **Terraform, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes**, and **Jenkins**. I've built **CI/CD pipelines**, worked with a variety of **AWS services**, and explored integrating **AI into cloud workflows** using modern **serverless tools**. I enjoy building systems that are **scalable**, **reliable**, and **easy to manage**.
